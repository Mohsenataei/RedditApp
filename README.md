# Reddit App

## Introduction

Showcase application made by @PedroCarrillo made to collect information and learn about RxJava.

The application was made in the following order:

1. [RxJava with Retrofit Reddit API calls](https://github.com/PedroCarrillo/RedditApp/tree/rxJavaExperimental)
2. [Composite adapters](https://github.com/PedroCarrillo/RedditApp/tree/composite_adapter)
3. [Pagination](https://github.com/PedroCarrillo/RedditApp/tree/pagination)
4. [MVP](https://github.com/PedroCarrillo/RedditApp/tree/mvp)
5. TBD

All of them are in different branches so you can see the process from scratch.

I would like to get some feedback in order to improve my current coding style and help other people that are trying to learn.
